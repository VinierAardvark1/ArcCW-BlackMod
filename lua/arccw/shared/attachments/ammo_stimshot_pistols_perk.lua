att.Description = [[A modified, more helpful variant of the bullet-to-dart mechanism used by the infamous CRM-409 "Plague Darts." Rather than infecting targets with a hyper-lethal, hyper-infectious virus, the dart is filled with a small dose of epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, put in a saline solution. The darts are intended to be used at close-to-medium range to get fellow operatives back on their feet in the heat of battle, but a skilled marksman can easily deliver long-ranged healing if required. As this dart is about the size of a pistol bullet and does not produce enough force to cycle a weapon's action, it's common practice to treat all guns as single shot while in use.
These things are pretty fuckin' awesome. Although I've heard that using epinephrine doubles the change of severe brain damage. But what do I know? I'm a black market arms dealer, not a doctor. Hell, I had to look up what epinephrine was when I was given the package.]]
