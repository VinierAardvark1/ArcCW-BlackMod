Another one from our favorite VHS company. This one isn't as fancy as the others, just a curved spike on the grip of your gun. Personally, I'd think putting an axe head on your stock would not only be more effective, but also a lot cooler. I guess this could work on smaller weapons or pistols, although that would need every mag you use to be spiked.
Eh, I guess this is the best option they had. Careful not to snag it on your rig, though.]]
