att.Description = [[A modified, more helpful variant of the bullet-to-dart mechanism used by the infamous CRM-409 "Plague Darts." Rather than infecting targets with a hyper-lethal, hyper-infectious virus, the dart is filled with a small dose of epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, put in a saline solution. The darts are intended to be used at close-to-medium range to get fellow operatives back on their feet in the heat of battle, but a skilled marksman can easily deliver long-ranged healing if required. As this dart is about the size of a rifle bullet and does not produce enough force to cycle a weapon's action, it's commonly used with bolt or break action rifles.
These things are pretty fuckin' awesome. Although I've heard that using epinephrine doubles the change of severe brain damage. But what do I know? I'm a black market arms dealer, not a doctor. Hell, I had to look up what epinephrine was when I was given the package.]]
