att.Description = [[Heavy-duty, self-balancing stock with a cheek rest wrapped in duct tape and rope which greatly improves recoil control and stability, but takes much longer to aim with and hinders hipfire substantially.
Found this in some LA gangster's hideout when I, uh, went to collect some debts. Think he made it himself, judging by how much work my boys downstairs did before letting me look at it again.]]
