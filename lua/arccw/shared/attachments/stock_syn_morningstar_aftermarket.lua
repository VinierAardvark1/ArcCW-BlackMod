Well, I'll be damned. They made a weighted stock specifically to bash people's skulls in with. Unfortunately, I think my ideas is better; had my guys strap an axe blade to the thing. Now it's three times as badass! Give it a whirl, but it is a little awkward to hold... moves the center'a mass a bit too much. Try not to cut yourself while firing, yeah?]]
